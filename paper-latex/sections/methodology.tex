In this section, we detail the methods and approaches we will be using in our research. The methodology is structured as follows:

\subsection{Code Module Setup}
The code module will be set up for all the DA solution to run in a simulated environment. This will help us to benchmark the performance of each DA solution under controlled conditions. The code module will have the below specified structure:


Also the code module will be open sourced for the community to use and verify the results.
\subsection{Comparative Graphs }
We will be using various comparative factor to graph out the differences in the data availability solutions. We will also provide a code based module setup that will generate the graphs based on the performance of the actual data availability solutions.

% \subsection{Data Collection}
% Data was collected through surveys distributed to a sample population. The survey included questions designed to assess various parameters relevant to our study.

% \subsection{Data Analysis}
% The collected data was analyzed using statistical methods, including descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, to draw meaningful conclusions.

% \subsection{Limitations}
% We acknowledge certain limitations in our methodology, including potential biases in survey responses and the representativeness of the sample. 

% Future research may address these limitations by employing a more diverse sample and utilizing mixed methods for data collection.
